# Example environment file for the Integration Frontend (Next.js)
# If this is not set, the app falls back to same-origin for backend calls, suitable when served behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.
# Set this when your backend API is hosted on a different origin or port.
#
# Example: http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Explicit full callback URL to display/use in UI when needed.
# Backend is authoritative for redirect_uri, but exposing this helps ensure consistency in links and docs.

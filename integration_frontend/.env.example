# Note: The OAuth redirect_uri is controlled by the backend via ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI.
# Ensure your Atlassian app has the exact redirect URI used by the backend:
# https://vscode-internal-21156-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3001/api/oauth/atlassian/callback
# No redirect_uri needs to be set here in the frontend.
